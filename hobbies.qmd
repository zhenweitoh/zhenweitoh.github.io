# My Hobbies

Welcome to a glimpse of what I do when I step away from the tech world. From giving back to the community to exploring the beauty of nature, here's what fuels my free time and enriches my life.

## Community Engagement

I believe in making a difference through active involvement in community services. Whether it's volunteering at The Purple Parade or organizing blood donation drives, I find immense satisfaction in helping others.

## Environmental Conservation

As an advocate for our planet, I participate in environmental CCAs and initiatives like tree planting and educational workshops on sustainability. These activities not only help the environment but also spread awareness about the importance of conservation.

## World Explorer

Traveling opens new horizons and offers fresh perspectives. I've had the privilege to visit places like Bali, where the rich culture and stunning landscapes have left a lasting impression on me.
